# Elevator System Modeling

## Project Overview

This project focuses on modeling an elevator system using Timed Arc Petri Nets (TAPN) and Unified Modeling Language (UML). The purpose of this model is to provide a detailed simulation of the operations and timing behaviors of an elevator system, inspired by the methodologies described in Kassem A. Saleh's book. This model aims to help in understanding and improving elevator control mechanisms through rigorous simulation and analysis.

## Features

- **Timed Arc Petri Nets**: Utilizes TAPN for modeling the dynamic and timing aspects of the elevator operations.
- **Unified Modeling Language**: Uses UML diagrams to represent structural and behavioral features of the elevator system.
- **Simulation**: Allows for the simulation of various scenarios to evaluate the performance and efficiency of elevator operations under different conditions.

## Installation

To run the simulations and view the UML diagrams, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/elevator-system-model.git
2. Install Papyrus software
